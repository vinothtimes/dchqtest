About english_default.php

english_default.php is the file where you can place your custom language 
labels for your module.

This is only needed if you want your module translatable in to other languages.

Do not create any other language files. The language Editing / Translation 
tool in the Admin will automatically pick the labels up and place them
in to job board's main language files.

All you need to do is place the language strings to this file and then 
use the Editing / Translation tool to translate your labels (if needed).

Some tips about english_default.php:

- Be sure to allways name your lables with a unique name, and prefix the
name with the name of the module. 
- Be sure to always follow the syntax and syle of the original 
english_default.php file
- Do not add any additional code or define any other variables
- Do not rename english_default.php and always ensure that it is placed
in the module's lang/ directory
