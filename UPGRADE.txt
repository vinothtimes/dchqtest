Upgrade to 3.6.x series

If you are upgrading from 3.5.x or older, it is recommended that the upgrade
is performed on a copy (dev version) of your website instead of the real 
website. That way, you have more time to test things and there is no need
to rollback if things go wrong. For more details about this approach, please
see the following article:
https://www.jamit.com.au/support/index.php?_m=knowledgebase&_a=viewarticle&kbarticleid=238

Upgrade to 3.6.x notes:

** Updates to the templates will be needed **

The job board will prompt further instructions in Admin for how
to make the changes to your templates.

** Moved fckeditor/, scw/, overlib/, wz_dragdrop/ **
These directories were moved form the root directory to include/lib/ 
This is one of the main reasons why update to the templates is needed.

** New PHP file: upload_files/dl.php **
Please remember to upload this file. Also, please don't forget
/lang/lang.php

Please go to Admin->Main Config and click the Save button at least
once. This will ensure that the config.php is correct.

====================================

UPGRADE From versions 3.6.x to later versions

FILES TO UPLOAD

To upgrade, you can simply re-upload all the files, except the files
in the 'do not upload list'

This includes the following:

- Files form the main directory (but do not re-upload config.php or rss.xml)
- include/* and include/themes/default/* (assuming that you have created your
own custom theme in a separate directory and have not modified any other 
files there)
- myjobs/*
- employers/*
- payment/*
- admin/
- lang/english_default.php and lang/lang.php (but do not 
 re-upload any of the other language files)

UPGRADE DATABASE

After uploading, log in to Admin and hit the 'Upgrade Database' button
on the first screen that you see (Admin->Main)

This button will only be visible if upgrades to the database are needed.
After hitting this button, the system will upgrade the database structure
for your database, keeping your original data preserved. (Its good practice
to keep a backup of your database)

QUICK UPLOAD TIP

You only need to upload the changed files. The best way to work out which
files were changed is to sort the files by date. Your ftp client
should be able to do this if you click on the 'Filename' column heading.

Then you only upload the files which have a later date than the release
date of your currently installed version.

On slower connections, this may save you a lot of time.

*FTP CONSOLE*

To save you even more time with FTP-ing the files, we've added an FTP
uploading tool to the customer's download center here:
https://www.jamit.com/ipn/ipnm.php

DO NOT UPLOAD LIST:

- don't upload files in the lang/ directory (except english_default.php and
lang.php which needs to be re-uploaded)
- don't upload rss.xml
- don't upload config.php



NOTES

For history of changes to the templates, see
include/themes/CHANGES.txt

The default theme is located in include/themes/

Final tip...

Please, remember to BACKUP before the upgrade!

====================================

UPGRADE From version 2.x - 

For convenience, any newer version of the job board will automatically upgrade
your database if an older version is detected. All your data will be preserved.

However, because version 3 is structurally different from version 2, you would
need to install the software in a new folder and build your site from the 
ground up using the new theme system. Here is the overview of the recommended 
procedure:

1. Install the software in a separate directory which you can easily
use for development without affecting your real site.

2. Customize a theme for your site. This is done the same way as before
when the header.php and footer.php were edited, except these files have
now been moved to the include/themes/default/ directory. 
See include/themes/README.txt for detailed instructions about how to create 
a new theme. The simplest themes need to only customize about 3 files (header,
footer and main.css).

3. Test your new theme. Once it is ready you may change your site 
over to your new version by replacing the new version files with the old.

Notes

-Your old config.php 2.x is not compatible with the new 3.x version
You will need to replace all your files including config.php


A great tip

To migrate form your old main.css to version 3.x, It is best 
to use a tool such as WinMerge available form http://www.winmerge.org and it's
a free download. We really recommend that you become familiar with this tool 
because it is a huge time-saver and allows you to compare changes visually and 
merge the changes together with the click of a mouse button (no need to type / 
copy & paste).

Question

I do not understand the upgrade process for upgrading from v2 to v3
Can you give me a quick summary?

Answer

When upgrading to version 3, then version 3 files need to be totally 
replaced with version 2. 

So we would recommend that you install it in a separate directory first. 
See the updated installation instructions on our Docs page 
http://www.jamit.com/docs.htm

For the database settings for v3, just enter your old v2 database settings.

Then you should customize your new v3 job board using the new theme system. 
See include/themes/README.txt for more info about new theme system and 
how to create your own theme.

Once you are ready, you delete v2 files and shift v3 to where v2 was. 
Just remember to update the paths in config.php after shifting it.
